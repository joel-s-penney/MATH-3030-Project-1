            This paper studies six algorithms used to solve root-finding problems involving single-variable polynomials. Specifically, we consider theoretical foundations such as the intermediate value theorem as well as the details of iterative rules to explain the differences between several bracketed and open methods. The six algorithms are also compared under challenging circumstances such as flat regions and Wilkinson's polynomial. We find that no algorithm performs consistently better than all of the others, although TOMS748 and Halley's method are often able to locate roots quickly. As we demonstrate, the structure of the root-finding problem influences the chosen approach, relevant theory considered, and the methods applied to efficiently find roots.
